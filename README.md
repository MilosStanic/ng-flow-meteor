# ng-flow-meteor

This is an attempt to demonstrate usage of [ng-flow] with [angular-meteor] to upload files to a [Meteor] application.

The whole thing happens in the [controller],  [service] and [model] files.

A lot of the code is directly ripped off from **@pbastowski**'s [meteor-upload-files] and from **@epotvin**'s [thumbnail-example].

Please feel free to clone and run it, and file issues and pull requests.
